# MeGraCon Frontend
The frontend created for use with **MediaGraph Construction (MeGraCon)** framework (Master thesis of Huiran Duan) and [MediaGraph Store](https://github.com/lucaro/MeGraS)

This frontend leverages some utility code and features from [MeGraS-demo](https://github.com/JaanWilli/MeGraS-demo). It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
